            <P class="para">This is a web-based rpg game if you click the Play button nothing will happen as it is in development and nothing is yet developed by the programmer except this page as the programmer is very lazy also the programmer doesn't even know how to develop the game. He's just learning basic html & CSS. The game is not possible without javascript. The programmer is trying very hard to learn the basics but he can barely manage time. </P>
